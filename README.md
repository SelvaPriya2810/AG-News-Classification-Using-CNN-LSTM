AG News Classification Using Deep Learning
Overview
This project focuses on classifying AG News articles into four categories: World, Sports, Business, and Science/Technology using Deep Learning techniques. The dataset is sourced from TensorFlow Datasets (AG News Subset), and the model is built using LSTM and CNN architectures.

Project Features
Data Preprocessing: Text cleaning, stopword removal, tokenization, stemming.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Class distribution visualization, word clouds, bigram analysis.
Model Implementation:
LSTM Model: A sequential LSTM-based deep learning approach.
CNN Model: A convolutional neural network for text classification.
Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
Confusion Matrix and Precision-Recall Curve.
